### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- Analyze costs: App Service is cheaper than VM, scalability: this web app is using small resources and is less scalable so it is not a concern now, availability: both are highly available, VM is slightly better but it is not a concern now, and workflow: using App Service is simpler and faster
- My solution is App Service for deploying the app
- App Service has the advantage of being cheaper, simpler and faster to deploy, scalability and available is not a concern.
- If the application has a high demand for availability, scalability, control the underlying OS, install software on the server or change languages, then VM is better.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
